## Neologism brings challenges | Background 

> Big data Big impact on Lexicography?

- Algeo (1993) points out, the majority of new words in fact fail to become established in language, and even those words that do make it into dictionaries often fall out of usage. (quoted from `r citep(bib[['cook2010exploiting']])`)  

> 舊詞都在，新詞不來。

## Lexicalization and Language Change

詞彙與詞彙化的變遷研究

> - Language in use is a dynamically developing system adapting to its ever-changing social environment.
> - Language change: phenomenon or epiphenomenon (of a static capacity, Lehmann 1993:320)?
> - Lexicalization: the process by which new items that are considered 'lexical' come into being (Brinton and Traugot, 2005)
  - __adoption into the lexicon__
  - __falling outside the productive rules of grammar__


---

## The Emergent Lexicon 

- Lexicon is understood as *a finite list of forms and the possibilities for combining them*

- Functionalistic take on the (Mental) Lexicon (,if any):
    - 'our understanding of both language structure and use is enhanced by the recognition that memory for language is highly affected by language use' (Bybee,1998).
    - The memory representation of language consists of units that can constitute utterances or intonation units, i.e., not just words, but also phrases and constructions. 

- It is the __formulation__ that annoies linguists.


---

## The Emergent Lexicon 

$$
\mathbf{Change}_{a,b} = \mathbf{A} \succ \mathbf{B}
$$

$$
\mathbf{Change}_{a,b} = \mathbf{A} \succ 
 \begin{Bmatrix}
  A \\
  B 
 \end{Bmatrix}
 \succ \mathbf{(B)}
$$

`Most attention were paid to the questions "What is in the arrow?" and "How does change come about?"`

## Questions to be answered 
  
**Big Three** (Brinton and Traugott, 2005)

1. The constraint problem: what is the set of possible changes and linguistic conditions for change?
2. The transition problem: what are the intresting stages that define the path by which A gives rise to B?
3. The actuation problem: how does change start, when and where does it start ('actuation') and how does it spread through the system ('actualization')?

## Linguistic approach | Neologism and Lexicalization

- Lexicalization is viewed as the way to enrich the lexicon. Lipka (1990) "..the phenomenon that a complex lexeme once coined tends to become a single lexical unit, a simple lexeme."
- Neologisms (new entries in the inventory) can be seen as the results of the *conception of lexicalization*.
- The production of neologisms encompasses a wide variety of linguistic processes, both sybchronic and diachronic.
- Mechanisms involved: *create, modify, combine,* or *separate* existing units, and thus lexicalization would seem to include opposing directions of change leading to greater or lesser **dependency** and greater or lesser **compositionality**.

## Linguistic approach | Neologism Classification
  
1. [`Renouf's classification` 2013]: 

  * __lexical neology__ (i.e., newly-coined lexical items) e.g, [Arab Spring](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Arab%20spring&cmpt=q);
  * __semantic neology__ (i.e., new sense of word) e.g, 'troll' (an individual who posts inflammatory, rude, and obnoxious comments to an online community); 'sick' (mean ‘excellent’, an amelioration)
  * __grammatical neology__ (i.e., neologisms that change grammatical class).  [friend](http://www.wordnik.com/words/friend)


2. Note: various **morphological mechnisms** for lexical neology: *lexical blends* (e.g., 'webisode' is a blend of web and episode), *text messaging forms* (e.g., 'any1' for anyone).`r citep(bib[['cook2010exploiting']])`

3. *lexical neology* and *semantic neology* can be identified in a text corpus at surface level by automatic means (by comparing existing lexicon and discovering the change in collocational environments), while *grammatical neology* can be identified at a post-processing stage of semantic neology.

## Psycholinguistic | Neologism and Lexical Memory

> How do neologisms leave the memory trace in our mental lexicon? (frequencies of exposure, types of neologisms, ...)


- `r citep(bib[['de2007regular']])` For the neologisms, a stepwise mixed-effect regression analysis resulted in a model with significant main effects of Length, and Number of Synsets. As for the existing words, ratings increased with increasing Length ($\hat{\beta}$ = 0.238, t(877) = 2.805, p = .0051) and decreased for increasing Numbers of Synsets ($\hat{\beta}$ = −0.560, t(877) = −3.359, p = .0008). 新詞 詞長度越長，越熟悉。 synset 數量越多（越多義）越不熟悉。

## Leixogrpahy in Practice
> How do you decide whether a new word should be included in an Oxford dictionary?

- paradox: in order to find usages of a previously undocumented word suspected of being new, one would have to wait until it was encountered during reading (Barnhart, 1985).

- corpus-based/aided method changed lexicographer's works. `r citep(bib[['atkins2008oxford']])`

<!--The Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary broke new ground in lexicography by being the first dictionary to be based entirely on corpus evidence (Sinclair, 1987).

## Leixogrpahy in Practice

`r citep(bib[['metcalf2004predicting']])` : FUDGE factors for determining whether a word will remain in usage


$$latex
\Sigma (\mathcal{F}_{0-2}, \mathcal{U}_{0-2}, \mathcal{D}_{0-2}, \mathcal{G}_{0-2}, \mathcal{E}_{0-2})
$$

- F: Frequency
- U: Unobtrusiveness
- D: Diversity of users and situations
- G: Generations of other forms and meanings
- E: Endurance of the concept to which the word refers.


---
## Leixogrpahy in Practice

`r citep(bib[['barnhart2007calculus']])`: 

$$latex
\mathcal{V} * \mathcal{F} * \mathcal{R} * \mathcal{G} * \mathcal{T}
$$

- V: the number of forms of *w*
- F: the frequency of *w*
- R: the number of sources in which *w* occurs
- G: the number of genres in which *w* occurs
- T: the time span over which *w* has been observed.

## Corpus-based Applied Lexicology 


- **Frequency effect** takes the lead and entrenchment drives the effect?
- Quantitative formulation (..) delineate proposed life stages and "predict whether a word may be survived after being coined".

---
## Corpus-based Applied Lexicology | Stages

- `r citep(bib[['kerremans2014web']])`  : four stages of conventionalization.

- Life cycle of a word: *birth, settling down, obsolescence, death, and re-birth* (Renouf 2013)


---
## Corpus-based Applied Lexicology 


啟示

- Product-words (P-words) : driven exogenously by events that are external to the group
- Slang-words (S-words): more endogenously influenced by the social values and language patterns of the communication group.


- indexicality: being used by different individuals
- topicality: being used in different topics.


---
## Quantitative Lexicology 


> since neologisms are expected to be rather infrequent due to the recency of their coinage, methods for lexical acquisition that rely solely on statistical distributional information are not well-suited for learning syntactic or semantic properties of neologisms, particularly those which have very low frequency. `r citep(bib[['cook2010exploiting']])`

## Computational Approach | Novel word sense detection

<!-- 
http://cs.unb.ca/~ccook1/elex2013.pdf
-->


*** {class: active, id: language resources}

You need **corpus and lexicon** are the prerequisite for an empirical surveys. A *reference* corpus will make the identification task simpler: An *unseen* word is matched against the corpus so that it is pinpointed at its first occurrence, and deemed to be a candidate for neologism. (cf. *hapax legomena*)

*** {id: algorithms}

<img src="assets/img/pipeline.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 450px;"/>

Use **collocational information** to (semi-) automatically determine the candidate's usage and definition.

## Our concern

- Do we have the chance to develop a stabalization measure of neologisms that indicate whether they are likely to remain in usage, (and therefore should be included in a dictionary). 

- What's the role of linguistic knowledge in this exploratory process


---
## Our Approach | Going deep with big data

- Tsunami of data 

<!-- However, because of a lack of precise knowledge of the value embedded within this huge crush of data, many businesses have been stuck in the “data for data’s sake” trap .... Deep data? another industry buzzword?--> 

- Deep data trumps Big data : "Deep Data framework– an approach based on the premise that a small number of information-rich data streams, leveraged properly, can yield more value than masses of captured data"

- train on big data, exploit the deep linguistic knowledge based on even small number of usages.

## Our Approach | Targets

<!-- BORN :The time span over which a word has been used —the date between the first citation-->

* Focus only on: 
  * words that are `newly diffused` (for about 1 years).
  * words that have been already `conventionalized`. (existed over around 50 years)

<!-- words that are `inactivated`.-->

* Hypothesis
  - 跟競爭/適者生存有關係 e.g. ic vs ical
  - Linguistic knowledge can be exploited to infer the survival chance.


---
## Discovering Influential Factors 

What are the driven (linguistic) factors for a lexical item to enter the *collective mental lexicon*?

* (Short-term) usage frequency pattern
* Social network



---
## Time-series: a pilot study for short-term frequency

- (Chang 2008; Wang 2010) proposed to use normalized frequency within a year or so to judge whether a once diffused new word is conventionalized is using or is failed to be captured.

- Xu(1999) proposed that 10 years should be the criteria.

## 頻率對新詞穩定量度難用


- Since the Surface Frequency measure is 'zero' for all neologisms, hard to be a good indicator for stablization index.

- 也容易受特定事件影響。Some words may sporadically come into fashion in certain external events.
e.g., 挺 may come and go follow the start and end of election. 花博。本研究把與特定事件 bind 在一起的叫做 fashion word, 不處理。

## Linguistic Niche | Lexical Social Network

- "New words which are in competition with an already established word (i.e., the new word and established word are roughly synonymous) are more likely to succeed than new words which are not in competition with an established form". `r citep(bib[['boulanger2002makes']])`, quoted from `r citet(bib[['cook2010exploiting']])`).

<!-- You can imagine that In the no-competition case, both the new word and new referent must be accepted.-->

## Magic Formular identified 

Measure of Inclusion:
$$latex
\mathbb{I} = \ln( \alpha \mathcal{F} * \beta \frac{S}{P}) 
$$

- F: frequency diversity within short-term time span (revised constant U)
  - number of sources (ptt and newspapers)
  - number of genres (different boards)

<!--
1. some of these properties may play a larger role in determining a word’s importance for inclusion in a dictionary than others. A supervised machine learning algorithm could be used to learn an optimal weighting for the various properties. 
2. it may also be the case that applying a non-linear transformation to the values for the properties—such as the natural logarithm—could make the values more informative; taking the natural logarithm has the effect of emphasizing the differences between smaller values, which may be particularly important in the case of frequency, since neologisms are expected to have relatively low frequency.

動態抓海量資料[頻率]，但是用語言學來採礦。
We pick up every new lexical data stream if it ... <!--Instead of going down the big data path, where there's a lot of data you could potentially analyze, but for relatively little incremental gain, we instead [focus on] the bare minimum that tells us the most about a building-->


---
## Conclusion

B & D 
- Big linguistic data 
- Deep linguistic knowledge can help identify the stabalization process of neologisms, and we have proposed a reproducible, dynamically updated measure for Chinese lexical stablization.

- 

Limits and Future works include:
- Evaluate the results against lexicographers.
- 除了進場機制，字典也該有退場機制（或是字詞使用年紀標記）
neologism as forms which have been recently added to the language vs 'established forms in a dictionary' is an questionable contrast
